# Question N.1: Variable bacon contains the intger value 23.
# Question N.2: The first term is equal to the string 'spamspamspam' and the second term is equal to the string 'spamspamspam' (in essence both terms are equal to the same string 'spamspamspma').
# Question N.3: The break statement stops the loop at a given point and the code continues outside the loop/conditional code block. The continue statement skips the current iteration of the code block and continues to the next iteration.
# Question N.4: Practically, all these statements refer to the same range of numbers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), but each statement contains different information about the range. Thus, the range(10) statement simply implies that the range starts from number 0 up to number 10, without containing number 10 in the range. Range(0,10) specifically states that counting starts from number 0 (if another number is given, the initial number could be different). Range(0,10,1) gives even more information about the range, stating that the step between the numbers of the range is 1 [if another value is passed in the argument - for instance range(0,10,2) - the step would be different - according to the previous example, the range wiuld be (0,2,4,6,8)].
